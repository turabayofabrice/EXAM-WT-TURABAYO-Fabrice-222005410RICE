                 This is a bike community on Mayotte in our MAESHA project. While our actions are wide-ranging when it comes to where we implement change, or through what means, at the heart of our approach to each of our projects is community. We view community members as key actors in developing meaningful and effective ways of coping with the difficulties that we aim to improve. Read about our different new and ongoing projects, and see how we centre community throughout our work.

            For many people, interacting with nature is a tourist and adventurous experience, but for those with whom I share a similar background, it is a way of life and a means of livelihood. Growing up in my neighbourhood in a remote area in Kenya, I experienced the challenges of human-wildlife conflict and the depletion of the natural resources we depended on for survival. We lost our nearest source of water, the rains subsided, resulting in low or no harvests. Drought became rampant and wildlife often moved into areas of human habitat in search of food and water, leading to human-wildlife conflict. As a young girl, I never understood what was happening to our beautiful environment and why children had to skip school to get water for the household.
